\title{Mixed Model for Imputation}
\usage{
defaultMixedModel(data, df = 1, weights = NULL, modelFormula = NULL,
  imputationParameters)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data.table object containing the data.}

\item{df}{The number of degrees of freedom for the spline.}

\item{weights}{The weights for the observations.}

\item{modelFormula}{Formula specifying how the dependent variable (value)
depends on the other columns of data.  Should be a valid mixed model
formula, as it will be passed to lmer (R's mixed model function).}

\item{imputationParameters}{A list of the parameters for the imputation
algorithms.  See defaultImputationParameters() for a starting point.}
}
\value{
Returns a vector of the estimated/imputed values.  If a value
existed in the original data, then an NA is returned in that location.
}
\description{
This function imputes missing values with a linear mixed model.
}
\details{
The default functionality of this model is to fit a linear mixed model to
the data.  time and intercept are assumed to be fixed effects, and the
random effects are specified by the byKey parameter of
imputationParameters.  So, for example, byKey may reference the variable
containing country data.  In that case, a model is fit which assumes a
linear relationship between production (or whatever dependent variable the
user has specified) and time.  However, the intercept and slope of this
fit varies from country to country, and so country is considered a random
effect.

Moreover, the model fit is not a simple linear regression, but rather a
spline regression (using the bs function from the \pkg{splines} package).
The fit of this model will therefore depend on the number of degrees of
freedom of this spline model (and, if the degrees of freedom is 1, then the
simple linear regression model is used).
