\usage{
buildEnsembleModel(data, imputationParameters, processingParameters)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data.table object containing the dataset we wish to impute
on.}

\item{imputationParameters}{A list of the parameters for the yield
imputation.  See defaultImputationParameters() for a starting point.}

\item{processingParameters}{A list of the parameters for the production
  processing algorithms.  See defaultProductionParameters() for a starting
  point.}
}
\value{
A list containing the model fit, model errors, and model weights.
}
\description{
This function should build an R object which contains all the information
from the ensemble models.  Thus, the object should be able to be loaded and
used to fill in imputed values and generate predictions using the originally
developed model (rather than requiring the model be refit each time).
}
\details{
To actually construct and save such a model object is unfortunately quite a
large task: we must save a model object for each individual model in
addition to the weights/errors from fitting these models to the data.  Thus,
instead of this task, we can just save the imputations and fill those in
when the impute module is called.  This also gives us the ability to version
control the imputations: we could put them in a new table in the SWS.
