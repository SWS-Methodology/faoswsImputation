##' Get Ensemble Weights via Inverse Errors
##'
##' Weights used to construct the final ensemble from the individual models are
##' computed by comparing the errors.  For each model, the errors are computed
##' (simply comparing observed values in data to fitted values in fits) and
##' then the inverse (i.e. 1/) these errors are used as the weights (after
##' rescaling to 1).  For example, if three models have errors of 1, 2, and 3
##' then the inverse errors are 1, 1/2, and 1/3.  We rescale these weights to
##' add to 1 and get 6/11, 3/11, and 2/11.
##'
##' @param data The data object containing the observations to impute.
##' @param fits A list of the fitted values.  These may be estimated via leave
##' one out cross-validation or directly.
##' @param imputationParameters A list of the parameters for the imputation
##' algorithms.  See defaultImputationParameters() for a starting point.
##'
##' @return A data.table containing the weight for each model within each byKey
##' group, as well as a few other (currently unused) statistics.
