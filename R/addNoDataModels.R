##' Add Ensemble Weights for Sets of the Data without Valid Observations
##' 
##' In some cases, countries (or whatever the byKey is) will not have any data
##' available.  In these cases, we can impute values for these observations via
##' an ensemble, but we'll need a method for weighting the models in the
##' ensemble.
##' 
##' This function computes the weights for these models by looking at the
##' cross-validation error of the global models and uses those errors to
##' determine the final weights.
##' 
##' @param data The data.table object containing the data which will be imputed.
##' @param weights A data.table containing the currently estimated ensemble
##' weights and errors.  These are used to compute the global errors and add new
##' weights for models with missing data.
##' @param imputationParameters A list of the parameters for the imputation
##' algorithms.  See defaultImputationParameters() for a starting point.
##' 
##' @return A data.table of the same format as weights.  This function is
##' really just a helper function for getEnsembleWeight, and so the output of
##' the function is specifically designed to be rbinded on to the weights
##' object in that function.
